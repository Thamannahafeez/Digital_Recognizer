# Digital_Recognizer

Problem description

The goal is to correctly identify digits from a dataset of tens of thousands of handwritten images.

Introduction

The project was done as a perfect introduction to Artificial Neural networks.
The dataset was obtained from MNIST

Two set of notebooks are uploaded:
- identification through XGBoost --> Digit_Recognizer
- identification through ANN --> Digit_Recogniser_NeuralNetwork
